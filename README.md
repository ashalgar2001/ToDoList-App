To-Do List App
A simple and efficient To-Do List application built using ReactJS. This app allows users to create, manage, and store their task lists directly in their browser's local storage. It ensures that the tasks remain available even after closing or reopening the browser, making it a reliable tool for task management.

Features --

Core Functionalities:
1.Add Tasks:
Input and save tasks that need to be completed.
2.Mark Tasks as Completed:
Use a checkbox to mark tasks as done for better organization.
3.Unmark Tasks:
Uncheck the checkbox if a task is mistakenly marked as complete or needs further action.
4.Delete Tasks:
Remove unnecessary tasks from the list.

Persistent Storage:
Tasks are stored in the browser's local storage, ensuring the list is preserved even after the browser is closed or refreshed.

How It Works--

Workflow:
1.Adding a Task:
Enter the task in the input field and click the "Add" button.
The task is displayed in the task list with a checkbox to mark its status.

2.Marking as Complete or Pending:
To mark a task as complete, click the checkbox. The task's appearance changes to indicate completion.
To revert a task back to pending, uncheck the checkbox, and the task status will update accordingly.

3.Deleting a Task:
Click the "Delete" button next to a task to remove it permanently from the list.

4.Local Storage:
The app automatically saves the updated task list to the browser's local storage.
Upon reopening the app, the saved tasks are loaded and displayed.
